## "Imitation Learning from Simulation" for challenge `aido1_LF1-v3`

This is a behavioral cloning (the simplest IL implementation) baseline for the lane following challenge.

The [online description of this challenge is here][online].

## Description

This repository contains a baseline implementation of Imiation Learning via Supervised Learning (a.k.a Behavioral Cloning).

To achieve our goal to directly estimate a policy for the Lane Following problem, we divided this baseline into three parts:
Logging, Training, and Evaluation.

We leave it open to your creativity any other implementations that can be derived from baseline.
